How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
It's really important to me that the site is beautiful, but I know that design must enhance content not get in the way. Thus, I want the website to be really simple and easy to navigate as well. I dont want users to have to think about where they might go for certain content and I certainly don't want to hurt anyones eyes with unpleasant aesthetic!

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
Keeping it simple will help a lot. Making sure the graphics and color palette aren't too busy and colors that are easily legible.
